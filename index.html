            Involved in creating the software prototype of mavry.io, a
            decentralised platform built on top of the Ethereum blockchain to
            connect quality employers with skilful freelance workers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Hired as a front-end developer, I improved the layout and
            responsiveness of website according to clients' specifications to
            create a more user-friendly experience
          </p>

          <p>
            However, due to hefty transaction costs, I was also tasked to
            migrate certain features of the app off the blockchain and onto a
            server and database. This challenged me to develop my back-end
            skills, despite being outside my job scope.
          </p>

          <p>
            This process also required me to be intimately familiar with
            blockchain and smart contract development, pushing me to expand my
            scope of knowledge.

          <p>
            Raffles Hall Developers is a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) in Raffles
            Hall, where students utilise their skills to improve the quality of
            life for all residents.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the head of the CCA, I was in charge of overseeing all activities
            including training and product development for all 50 members, many
            of whom do not have any prior experience before joining us.
          </p>

          <p>
            Together, we made a Progressive Web App that deconflicts bookings of
            facilities within the hall, as well as facilitate collation of
            supper orders between residents to minimise delivery fees. We also
            make various telegram bots such as one that forwards announcements
            by authorised users to various group chats.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was also the main organiser of the first ever Inter-Hall
            Hackathon, where residents between different halls compete to
            generate ideas and prototypes across 4 days. The event also features
            various workshops and networking sessions by various companies and
            alumnis across the industry, exposing participants to a wide range
            of career paths.

          <p class="experience-date">May 2021 - Aug 2021</p>

          <p>
            As part of NUS's Orbital program, my partner and I built a
            decentralised web application built on Ethereum blockchain that
            allows users to create, buy and sell Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)
            representing Reddit posts, so that Reddit content creators can
            monetise their posts and buyers can own a piece of social media
            history.
          </p>

          <p>
            We were able to attain the Artemis (Extreme) tier, which is the
            highest level of acheivement.
          </p>

          <p>
            I had the opportunity to work with a lot of tools that I had no idea
            existed prior to embarking on this project. For example,
            Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralised system of
            storing files without the expensive transaction fees. We use it to
            store the metadata of every NFT we mint, thus reducing cost of
            computation on the chain while still preserving the decentralised
            appeal of NFTs.

          <p>
            As a teaching assistant for NUS's introductory programming course
            CS1101S (Programming Methodology), I was responsible for conducting
            weekly tutorial sessions as well as grade submissions for a class of
            8 students.
          </p>

          <p>
            Watching my students improve and gain confidence in the subject is
            extremely gratifying, thus I intend to take up this role in future
            semesters as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            This also reinforces my understanding of the module, gaining a
            deeper appreciation its contents.
